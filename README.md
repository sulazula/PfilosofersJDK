Five philosophers sit at a table, alternating between thinking and eating. To eat, each philosopher needs two forks, 
but there are only five forks, one between each pair of philosophers. 
The goal is to ensure that philosophers can eat without causing deadlock, starvation, or race conditions while managing shared resources (forks).
